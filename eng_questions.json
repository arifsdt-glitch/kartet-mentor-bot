    "passage": "A small crowd had gathered around the entrance to the park. His curiosity \naroused, Robert crossed the road to see what was happening. He found that the centre \nof attraction was an old man with a performing monkey. The monkey's tricks, he soon \ndiscovered, were in no way remarkable. So, after throwing a few pennies in the dirty hat \nwhich the man had placed on the pavement, Robert moved off, along with other \nmembers of the crowd.\nAt this point the man suddenly let out a loud cry. Everyone \nturned to see what had happened. The man was bending over his monkey, which now \nlay quite still on the pavement. He picked up the apparently lifeless body and holding it \nclose to him, began to weep. A young man stepped forward from the crowd and taking \nsome money from his pocket, dropped it into the hat. Robert and several other people \ndid likewise, until the pennies in the hat were covered with silver coins.\nA few months \nlater, Robert came across the old man, again in another part of the city. The man had a \nmonkey, bought no doubt, with the money the crowd had given him. It did not, however, \nseem any better at its tricks than the previous one. Robert was pleased to see that the \nold man was still able to earn a living, though on this occasion, having partly paid for the \nmonkey out of his own pocket, he did not feel inclined to throw any money into the \nhat.\nBut the performance was not yet over. Once again the old man let out a loud cry. \nOnce again the monkey lay still on the pavement. The man picked up the \"dead\" \nmonkey and clutching it in his arms began to weep. The same young man stepped \nforward and threw some money into the hat. Again the crowd followed suit - except \nRobert. Smiling to himself, he went on his way, amazed at the man's audacity.",
