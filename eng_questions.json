    "passage": "A small crowd had gathered around the entrance to the park. His curiosity 
aroused, Robert crossed the road to see what was happening. He found that the centre 
of attraction was an old man with a performing monkey. The monkey's tricks, he soon 
discovered, were in no way remarkable. So, after throwing a few pennies in the dirty hat 
which the man had placed on the pavement, Robert moved oA, along with other 
members of the crowd.\nAt this point the man suddenly let out a loud cry. Everyone 
turned to see what had happened. The man was bending over his monkey, which now 
lay quite still on the pavement. He picked up the apparently lifeless body and holding it 
close to him, began to weep. A young man stepped forward from the crowd and taking 
some money from his pocket, dropped it into the hat. Robert and several other people 
did likewise, until the pennies in the hat were covered with silver coins.\nA few months 
later, Robert came across the old man, again in another part of the city. The man had a 
monkey, bought no doubt, with the money the crowd had given him. It did not, however, 
seem any better at its tricks than the previous one. Robert was pleased to see that the 
old man was still able to earn a living, though on this occasion, having partly paid for the 
monkey out of his own pocket, he did not feel inclined to throw any money into the 
hat.\nBut the performance was not yet over. Once again the old man let out a loud cry. 
Once again the monkey lay still on the pavement. The man picked up the \"dead\" 
monkey and clutching it in his arms began to weep. The same young man stepped 
forward and threw some money into the hat. Again the crowd followed suit - except 
Robert. Smiling to himself, he went on his way, amazed at the man's audacity.",

When the fox saw her he became happy and he said to himself, \"looks like she's hurt and can't fly! I can easily catch and eat her!\" Then he ran towards her. The mother duck ran, leading the fox away from the lake. The fox followed her. Now he wouldn't be able to harm her ducklings. The mother duck looked towards her ducklings and saw that they had reached the lake. She was relieved. She stopped and took a deep breath. The fox thought she was tired and he came closer, but the mother duck quickly spread her wings and rose up in the air. She landed in the middle of the lake and her ducklings swam to her. The fox stared in disbelief at the mother duck and her ducklings. He could not reach them because they were in the middle of the lake. This way the duck fooled its enemy into thinking she was hurt and gave her children time to escape. Dear children, some birds drag one of their wings on the ground when an enemy is going to attack.
